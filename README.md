The core idea is to connect people based on their native language and the language they want to learn.Users can create a detailed profile, get recommendations for language partners, send friend requests, and start practicing immediately. The entire real-time communication suite—from instant messaging to HD video calls—is powered by the Stream API, ensuring a scalable and reliable experience.<br />Core Features🔐 Secure Authentication: Full JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication flow with signup, login, and protected routes.👤 Custom Onboarding: Users set up their profile with a bio, location, and—most importantly—their native and learning languages.🤝 Smart User Discovery: The homepage recommends other users who are native speakers of the language you're learning.❤️ Friend Request System: Connect with other learners by sending and accepting friend requests.💬 Real-time Chat: Instant 1-on-1 messaging powered by Stream Chat, complete with typing indicators, read receipts, and reactions.📹 HD Video Calling: Seamlessly initiate 1-on-1 video calls directly from the chat window, built with Stream Video SDK.🎨 32 Unique Themes: A theme selector (powered by DaisyUI and Zustand) allows users to customize their UI from 32 different color palettes.⚡ Modern Tech Stack: Built with a fully modern frontend using Vite, TanStack Query for server state, and Zustand for global client state.🛠️ Built WithThis project is built with a modern MERN stack and utilizes powerful third-party APIs for its core functionality.FrontendReact<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dreact%26logoColor%3Dblack" />Vite<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vite-646CFF%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dvite%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />Stream Chat SDK<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Stream%2520Chat-005FFF%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dstream%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />Stream Video SDK<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Stream%2520Video-005FFF%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dstream%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />TanStack Query<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-TanStack%2520Query-FF4154%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dreactquery%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />Zustand<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Zustand-000000%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge" />Tailwind CSS<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tailwind-06B6D4%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dtailwindcss%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />DaisyUI<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-DaisyUI-1AD1A5%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge" />BackendNode.js<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dnode.js%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />Express<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express-000000%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dexpress%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />MongoDB<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-47A248%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dmongodb%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />Mongoose<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mongoose-880000%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge" />JWT<img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/-JWT-000000%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Djsonwebtokens%26logoColor%3Dwhite" />🏁 Getting StartedTo get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.PrerequisitesNode.js (v18 or newer)npmMongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)Stream Account (for API Key and Secret)1.

2. Configure Environment VariablesThis project requires environment variables for both the frontend and backend.Backend (/backend)Create a .env file in the /backend directory and add the following:# Server Configuration
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string

# Stream API
STEAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
STEAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret

# JWT
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_jwt_key
Frontend (/frontend)Create a .env file in the /frontend directory and add the following:# Stream API Key (Public)
VITE_STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
3. Install Dependencies & RunYou can install dependencies and run both servers from the root directory.# Install backend dependencies
npm install --prefix backend

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install --prefix frontend
To run both servers concurrently:# Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server
npm run dev --prefix backend
